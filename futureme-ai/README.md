FutureMe 🚀

Chat with AI versions of your future self.
FutureMe is a generative AI application built with the Gemini 3 API that allows users to explore multiple possible futures based on their current life situation, goals, and challenges. The app simulates realistic life paths, offers actionable advice, and helps users visualize where their choices today could lead.


🌟 What is FutureMe?

FutureMe lets users input a few key details about their life — such as age, occupation, goals, and challenges — and then generates 3 distinct future self scenarios set 5–10 years ahead.

Each scenario:

Speaks in the voice of the user’s future self

Presents a believable career and lifestyle outcome

Highlights achievements, trade-offs, and lessons learned

Ends with a clear, actionable plan the user can start today

The result is an engaging, reflective, and motivating experience that blends reasoning, creativity, and personalization.
